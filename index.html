        This is the vision of the internet I had back in 1999, inspired by
        the blockbuster video game, <q><strong>Metal Gear Solid,</strong></q> as well as the style format
        of <strong>Windows 98</strong>. This was a time when coolness was defined by <em>restraint and
          non-chalance, attitude schooled behind indifference</em>. Styles in all fashions
        were reflecting that.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the style I envisioned at the time, counter to the bright and
        colourful websites that were dominating the late 90s, dazzling all who visit
        their web pages with glittering visuals and crisp sound bites. I didn't get to
        experience that at home, as the internet was very expensive, and our access was
        very limited, and monitored by my dad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Films were showing stylised versions of computing around the millenium, such as
        in blockbuster movies like <strong>Swordfish</strong>, and <strong>The Matrix</strong>. For someone growing up
        in
        the 90s, I was shown simple and satisfying ways to display information that
        appeal to a generation <em>obsessed</em> with grunge, boy bands, and girl groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of my internet browsing was at school, on <strong>BBC</strong>, <strong>AskJeeves</strong>,
        <strong>Lycos</strong>, or <strong>Yahoo</strong>.
        Graphics were minimal, used for icons or flashy animations, with few photos, being
        mindful of connection costs. Sounds would punctuate elements with a <em>ding</em> or a <em>whoosh</em>
        blasting through your speakers. The 90s were loud on the eyes and the ears.

        I was a child in the 90s, so everything was new for me, but everything also had
        a permanence, like it had always been there and always would be. I really had no
        concept of things being new or old, they just were, whether it was hearing a song
        on the radio, seeing a show on TV, or watching a movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way I experienced movies in the 90s was on VHS. I had some kids TV on those
        casettes, such as <strong>Budgie The Helicopter</strong>, <strong>Portland Bill</strong>, <strong>Mr
          Blobby</strong>, and <strong>Pingu</strong>,
        but the first movie I would watch was <strong>Toy Story</strong>, and I watched that almost daily.
        As for live-action, my first feature film was <strong>Stargate</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in live-action films on VHS were action movies. <strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong>, <strong>Tom
          Cruise</strong>, <strong>Tommy Lee Jones</strong>, I felt the influence of these authority figures in 
          catastrophic circumstances as role models of what it means to be a man, especially in changing times
        in social politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we were coming up to the millenium, society in the 90s chased <em>new</em> and <em>original</em> in ways
        that hadn't been seen in living memory, trying to imagine a <em>new world</em> for the 21st century.
        A world with innovation at the forefront of human endeavour. A world unrestrained by reality.

        <strong>Video games</strong>. They've been around almost as long as computers have, but the 90s gave us
        a monumental leap in graphical technology, able to present characters and worlds in 3D
        for the first time. The platforms at the forefront of this technology were the <strong>Nintendo
          64</strong> and the <strong>Sony PlayStation</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nintendo's <strong>N64</strong> was a powerhouse. A monstrous demonstration of gaming innovation and
        excellence virtually unrivalled at the time. It's ability to render and realise fully
        3D worlds was unparalleled. <strong>Mario</strong>, <strong>Turok</strong>, <strong>Goldeneye</strong>,
        <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>, all had gamers
        coming back time and again. It certainly left an impression on me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sony's <strong>PlayStation</strong> was truly revolutionary. It came with a shining storage solution in the
        form of CD. With it, came the ability to play across multiple disks, expanding the
        experiences of games considerably, something revered franchises <strong>Final Fantasy</strong>, <strong>Resident
          Evil</strong>, and <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong> all took advantage of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of my generation will argue which one of these consoles was the best, but for <em>me</em>,
        I wouldn't be who I am without <em>both</em> of them. What was cutting edge technology was also
        met with limitations, of scope, of cost, of time, yet true masterpieces were created in
        spite of those limitations.
