     <div class="p1">
         <p>This is the vision of the internet I had back in 1999, inspired by 
        the blockbuster video game, Metal Gear Solid, as well as the style format 
        of Windows 98. This was a time when coolness was defined by restraint and 
        non-chalance, attitude schooled behind indifference. Styles in all fashions 
        were reflecting that.
         </p>
     </div>
     <div class="p2">
         <p>This is the style I envisioned at the time, counter to the bright and 
        colourful websites that were dominating the late 90s, dazzling all who visit 
        their web pages with glittering visuals and crisp sound bites. I didn't get to 
        experience that at home, as the internet was very expensive, and our access was 
        very limited, and monitored by my dad.
         </p>
     </div>
     <div class="p3">
         <p>Films were showing stylised versions of computing around the millenium, such as 
            in blockbuster movies like Swordfish, and The Matrix. For someone growing up in 
            the 90s, I was shown simple and satisfying ways to display information that 
            appeal to the generation obsessed with grunge, boy bands, and girl groups.
         </p>
     </div>
     <div class="p4">
         <p>Much of my internet browsing was at school, on BBC, AskJeeves, Lycos, or Yahoo. 
        Graphics were minimal, used for icons or flashy animations, with few photos, being 
        mindful of connection costs. Sounds would punctuate elements with a ding or a whoosh 
        blasting through your speakers. The 90s were loud on the eyes and the ears.

         <p>I was a child in the 90s, so everything was new for me, but everything also had 
            a permanence, like it had always been there and always would be. I really had no 
            concept of things being new or old, they just were, whether it was hearing a song 
            on the radio, seeing a show on TV, or watching a movie.
         </p>
     </div>
     <div class="p6">
         <p>The way I experienced movies in the 90s was on VHS. I had some kids TV on those 
            casettes, such as Budgie The Helicopter, Portland Bill, Mr Blobby, and Pingu, 
            but the first movie I would watch was Toy Story, and I watched that almost daily. 
            As for live-action, my first feature film was Stargate.
         </p>
     </div>
     <div class="p7">
         <p>My interest in live-action films on VHS were action movies. Pierce Brosnan, Tom Cruise, 
            Tommy Lee Jones, I felt the influence of these authority figures in catastrophic 
            circumstances as role models of what it means to be a man, especially in changing times 
            in social politics.
         </p>
     </div>
     <div class="p8">
         <p>As we were coming up to the millenium, society in the 90s chased new and original in ways 
            that hadn't been seen in living memory, trying to imagine a new world for the 21st century. 
            A world with innovation at the forefront of human endeavour. A world unrestrained by reality.
